The Physics Simulation Engine is designed to simulate the movement and interaction of objects under various forces such as gravity, friction, and collisions.
The purpose of this engine is to provide accurate and real-time simulation for applications like video games, physics research, or educational tools. 
The system will simulate rigid body dynamics, handle force application, detect collisions between objects, and provide realistic collision responses.
